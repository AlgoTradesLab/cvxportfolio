Cvx_portfolio is a toolset for (convex) portfolio optimization and simulation,
based on our paper [Multi-Period Trading via Convex Optimization](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/cvx_portfolio.html).
It is written in Python 3, its major dependecies are [CVXPY](https://github.com/cvxgrp/cvxpy)
and [Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas).
