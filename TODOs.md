## Tests 
- [ ] fix them
- [ ] make them work with Travis
- [ ] ideally, they should work with python2

## Python 2
- [ ] not sure which features of python3 (other than print() and __matmul__) we're using. it might be easy to support also python2.

## Kelly
(It's a secondary objective)
- [ ] make a separate module that implements
 - [ ] a Kelly "returns" object (it won't be called `AlphaStream` any more)
 - [ ] a Kelly constraint that does the risk part
