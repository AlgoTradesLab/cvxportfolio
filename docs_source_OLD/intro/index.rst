Hello World
===========

We suggest to start with our basic "`HelloWorld`_" example. It sets up
a portfolio optimization problem and simulates a backtest with 5 years
of real market data. It then presents the results.

To run it locally install `jupyter`_
::

   conda install jupyter

and load the notebook file.

Continue by looking at the other :ref:`examples <examples>`,
also in jupyter notebook format,
or go straight to the :ref:`documentation <documentation>`.
