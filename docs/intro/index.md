# Hello World

We suggest to start with our basic "[HelloWorld]" example. It sets up
a portfolio optimization problem and simulates a backtest with 5 years
of real market data. It then presents the results.

To run it locally install [jupyter]

```
pip install jupyter
```

and load the notebook file.

Continue by looking at the other {ref}`examples <examples>`,
also in jupyter notebook format,
or go straight to the {ref}`documentation <documentation>`.
