# Examples

We present a few example applications built with CVXPortfolio.
Some of these have been developed for our [paper](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/cvx_portfolio.html) (number 2 to 6).

> 1. [HelloWorld]: basic usage of the simulation and (single period) optimization objects.
> 2. [DataEstimatesRiskModel]: download and clean the data used for the examples in our paper. (Its output files are available in the [data](https://github.com/cvxgrp/cvxportfolio/blob/master/data) folder of the repo.)
> 3. [PortfolioSimulation]: simple simulation of a portfolio rebalanced periodically to a target benchmark.
> 4. [SinglePeriodOptimization]: example of the single period optimization framework, with search of optimal hyper-parameters.
> 5. [MultiPeriodOptimization]: same for the multi period optimization framework.
> 6. [SolutionTime]: analysis of execution time of the simulation and optimization code.
> 7. [RealTimeOptimization]: get a vector of trades to execute in real time (exports to Excel format).
